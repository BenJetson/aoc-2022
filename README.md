# aoc-2022

This repository contains my solutions to the [2022 Advent of Code][aoc-2022],
written in [Go][golang].

## Structure

To see my solution code, go to the [days directory](./days).

## Commands

I have a few Go commands that make participating in AOC easier.

When running commands, the **working directory should be the repository root**.

### Initialize a Day

```sh
go run ./cmd/init --day X
```

This program initializes for a given advent calendar day by:

- creating a new directory in [days](./days);
- creating a `README.md` file in that day's directory for the puzzle text;
- creating a `solve.go` file in that day's directory for the solution code; and
- modifying [`days/days.go`](./days/days.go) to link that day's solver

| Flag    | Explanation                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--day` | The advent calendar day, an integer 1 through 25. |

### Get Puzzle

```sh
go run ./cmd/get_puzzle --day X --part Y
```

This program downloads the puzzle body text from the AOC server, translates the
HTML to markdown, and then saves it in that day's `README.md` file.

| Flag     | Explanation                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--day`  | The advent calendar day, an integer 1 through 25.  |
| `--part` | The puzzle part number, an integer, either 1 or 2. |

### Get Input

```sh
go run ./cmd/get_input --day X
```

This program downloads the puzzle input for my account from the AOC server and
saves it in that day's `input.txt` file.

| Flag    | Explanation                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--day` | The advent calendar day, an integer 1 through 25. |

### Run Solver

```sh
go run ./cmd/run --day X
```

This program runs the my solver code for a given advent calendar day.

By default, it uses my account's input from `input.txt` for that day. If you
would like to try your own input, you may pass a filename to the input flag.

| Flag      | Explanation                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--day`   | The advent calendar day, an integer 1 through 25. |
| `--input` | Optional, path to a different input file to use.  |

### Submit Answer

```sh
go run ./cmd/submit_answer --day 1 --part 1
```

This program submits the answer generated by my solver code for a given advent
calendar day and puzzle part to the AOC servers.

| Flag    | Explanation                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--day` | The advent calendar day, an integer 1 through 25. |

## Authentication

The commands that interact with the AOC servers require authentication.

AOC uses a session cookie to authenticate requests. After logging in, you can
find the value of this cookie using the developer tools in your browser.

The client expects to find the **value only** of the cookie in `.aoc-session` at
the repository root.

## Network Request Advisory

**⚠️ WARNING**: if you attempt to use the commands from this repository that
make network requests to the AOC servers, please **be respectful**.

The AOC maintainers ask that users do not make frequent automated requests.
